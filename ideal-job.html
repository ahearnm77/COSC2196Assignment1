        <p>For my ideal job I have chosen the position of Senior Data scientist.
          This position involves using machine learning on large, complex transactional datasets to better understand consumer behaviour.
          A Data Scientist is required to take huge amounts of data, process it, extract meaningful information, and then communicate that information.
          I am interested in this position because it would give me the opportunity to apply the latest technology and deductive reasoning to solve complex problems.
          It is a field with almost limitless application given the sheer amount of data we have collected in the 21st century.
          I am interested in a Data Scientist role because they are well paid positions that work on new and complex problems with the latest technology at the forefront of the field.</p>
        <p>This job advertisement states that the candidate will need a strong technical background (Python, SQL, and Machine learning experience).
          They also need experience building prototype models from scratch as well as strong interpersonal skills. Cloud skills are also desirable.
          It is interesting that this job does not state tertiary education requirements as these positions typically require at least an undergraduate qualification.</p>
        <p>My technical skills are currently limited to a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, Java and SQL.
          I have not yet implemented a protype model from scratch and have not worked with cloud computing in an enterprise environment.
          On the plus side I believe I have strong interpersonal skills developed through formal training and practical experience as an airline pilot, however I need to expose myself to more public speaking and work on my presentation abilities.</p>
        <p>I have split my plan to develop the required skill set into three components.
          Firstly, through my studies at RMIT I will learn the fundamental thought processes and skills behind programming languages and develop an experience with them in problem-based learning.
          Where possible I will seek opportunities to expose myself to SQL, SAS, Python and R, as well as Azure cloud computing.
          I will also mindfully engage in all group activities to continue to develop my presentation and teamwork ability.
          At this stage I think a minor in statistics would be the most beneficial choice but will reassess closer to time.
          I am aware that in Australia postgraduate studies are often required for these roles and on completion of my undergraduate I will consider enrolling in a postgraduate program that best rounds out my skill set.</p>
        <p>Secondly though work I will continue to develop my SQL experience, and volunteer for more complex projects relating to clientâ€™s database enquires.
          I will also gain firsthand experience working in a team.</p>
        <p>Thirdly as I continue to develop my abilities, I will involve myself in projects and competitions on Github to build my profile and gain experience building prototype models from scratch.
          I will aim to focus on areas that I have not had the opportunity to develop though my work or study.</p>
