  <h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest start?  Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</h3>
  <p>Like many people I have been interested in IT from an early age.  I was fascinated by videogames growing up and am often amazed by people’s ingenious ideas to apply IT to our daily lives.
    Aviation itself provides a strong example, the greatest safety improvements in the last 30 years were the traffic Collision and Avoidance System and the Ground Proximity Warning System.
    These two programmes have saved many lives.  I was particularly inspired when I learned that a colleague of mine had created an app that could pull a pilot’s roster from the airlines server and alert you to changes, as well as share those with family and friends.
    This was immediately useful as informing your family about last minute roster changes could get difficult.
    I particularly enjoyed sharing a monthly map of where I had flown.
    From there I started self-teaching for hobby projects using HTML, CSS and Java and am now working with SQL and XML in a client services role.</p>
  <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
  <p>My decision to enrol with RMIT was mainly influenced by the University’s proven track record in preparing its graduates for work by developing the skills and knowledge to succeed in their career.
    The emphasis on skill-based education and practical learning experiences really appealed to me as I believe this will best enable me to make the most of my career transition.
    The industry connections also inspire confidence that we will be learning the right skills for the modern workplace.
    Finally, and perhaps the most important reason was the flexibility to learn online and continue to work and build practical experience in the field while studying.</p>
  <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
  <p>Through this Degree I expect to learn the knowledge and skills required to succeed in the modern Information Technology sector through a combination of theory and practical, hands-on experience.
    My goal is to develop a wide variety of skills and knowledge to enable me to design, implement, support, and troubleshoot technologies including websites, databases and networks.
    I also expect to continue to develop my communication and teamwork skills. </p>
