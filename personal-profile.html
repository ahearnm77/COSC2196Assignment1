        <h4>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h4>
        <p>My personality profile of ENFJ-A ‘the protagonist/diplomat’ indicated that I am a passionate and charismatic individual with a natural leadership ability.
          An ENFJ can easily connect with people and understand their motivations as well as communicate ideals and goals to them.
          They are tolerant, altruistic, and reliable. My assertive result indicates that I am self-assured and resistant to stress.
          However, they can become hamstrung by absorbing too much of other people’s stress and at times can struggle to make hard decisions.
          My learning style indicates that I learn the best from hands on practical exercises and need to put abstract ideas and concepts into action before I fully grasp the concept.
          I also value rationality and objectivity, and find tutorials, storytelling and discussing helpful when learning new ideas.
          My front-line leader style shows I am genuine and use my emotional intelligence to connect with others.
          I use storytelling and my ability to be open with myself to communicate my vision and can empower my team to achieve their best. </p>

        <h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
          <p>These results may mean that I am good at working in teams because I am easily able to connect with others and share ideas.
            I should also be able to act in a leadership role if required.
            This coupled with my front-line leadership style means that I am able to understand where other people are coming from and empower them to perform their best,
            but must be careful not to take on too much of other people stress.
            My learning style preferring problem solving and practical activities coupled with my personality type indicates a strength for group assignments.  </p>

        <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
          <p>I was surprised to see the results of my personality profile!
            When I was first joining the workforce, I did several similar tests and usually came back with an INTJ result, with a strong learning towards introverted.
            While these tests are not entirely accurate, and many people arrive at inconsistent results it is possible that my experiences in the workplace have made me more extroverted.
            The result does seem consistent with my leadership style result and the pragmatist learning style feels accurate.
            I can take these results into account when forming a team by ensuring that I am considerate of the more introverted and passive members of my team by ensuring everyone is comfortable and able to contribute.
            I can use my ability to communicate goals to help keep the group on track. </p>
