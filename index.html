      <h2>Personal Information</h2>
      <p>Name: Matthew James Ahearn
        <br>RMIT Student number: 3884661</br>
        Email Address: s3884661@student.rmit.edu.au
      </p>
      <p>My name is Matthew Ahearn, I am an Australian citizen who has lived and worked in four cities in Australia and two in New Zealand.
        For the last ten years I have worked as an airline pilot after completing my Commercial Pilots Licence and an associated Diploma of Aviation.
        I was fortunate enough to work with an amazing group of people from all around the world. Probably the most dramatic moment in my flying career was when one of my engines failed shortly after take-off. Thankfully, we were able to return the
        aircraft to the departure aerodrome safely!</p>
      <p> I only speak the one language but thankfully my partner is a language teacher, and she can do the linguistic heavy lifting when we travel.
        We like to joke that I am learning another language as well – but mine is in the object-oriented group not the romance family!</p>
      <p>In the wake of the Covid pandemics’ impact on the aviation sector I am now retooling for a career transition to IT.
        I am eager to learn a new skill set and apply my analytic and interpersonal strength to a new challenge. </p>
